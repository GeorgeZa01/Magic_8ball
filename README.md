# Magic_8ball
This project implements a fully responsive and interactive Magic 8-Ball web application using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a sharp 2D visual design that simulates the appearance of the classic toy. When a question is submitted, the ball performs an engaging CSS shake animation before revealing a prediction.
